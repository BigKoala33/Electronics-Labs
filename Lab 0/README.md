This folder contains all the documents regarding the zeroth lab.

This lab is called Signals and Scope and it consists on Setting up the Lab-in-a-Box and the Signal Generator.

## Creating component storage

I found this step very tedious and long but I hope it will be worth it in the long run. I took a slightly different approach, I wasn't a huge fan of using the tape (although I ended up using some because some components were a bit loose). I used a thick carboard piece and punctured holes and I passed the legs of the resistors and the capacitors through them. I labelled them accordingly and stuck them to my wall.

 Here are some images

## Prepare wire stripper

This step was fairly hard as well. It took me quite a few iterations to get the right diameter. The next time I do it I should start by using wire as reference and very carefully adjust it. I ended up succeding and this is my current configuration.

## Prepare Signal Generator
Setting up the signal generator was fine. I didn't use as much tape and the image I used from the email Peter sent was not very clear but. But the new sheet is way better with schematics. Overall it was pretty easy and I started playing a bit with the signal generator and the oscilloscope.
