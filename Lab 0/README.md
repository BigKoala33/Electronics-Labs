This folder contains all the documents regarding the zeroth lab.

This lab is called Signals and Scope and it consists on Setting up the Lab-in-a-Box and the Signal Generator.

## Creating component storage

I found this step very tedious and long but I hope it will be worth it in the long run. I took a slightly different approach, I wasn't a huge fan of using the tape (although I ended up using some because some components were a bit loose). I used a thick carboard piece and punctured holes and I passed the legs of the resistors and the capacitors through them. I labelled them accordingly and stuck them to my wall.

 Here are some images
