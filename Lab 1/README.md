This github repository contains all the work done regarding the lab 1.

I have never used GitHub like this before so I hope it doesn't look ***too bad***.

### Task 1: Learning to control the signal generator
### Task 2: Setting up the Oscilloscope
### Task 3: Understanding the DSO dsiplay
### Task 4: Controlling the DSO with the buttons and the rotary switch
### Task 5: Triggering on an oscilloscope
### Task 6: Measure DC voltage
### Task 7: Measure sine wave signal
### Task 8: Measure PWN signal
### Task 9: Measure Exponential signal
### Task 10: UART signal
### Task 11: Test yourself on the unknown signals
